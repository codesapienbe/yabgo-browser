## 🛠️ Development Guide

*This section is for developers who want to contribute or build from source.*

### Architecture Overview

YABGO follows a clean, object-oriented architecture:

**Main Process** (System integration)
- `WindowManager` — Window lifecycle and configuration
- `DatabaseManager` — SQLite operations and history
- `IPCManager` — Inter-process communication
- `AssistantService` — Natural language processing

**Renderer Process** (User interface)
- `NavigationManager` — WebView control and URLs
- `UIManager` — User interface state
- `GestureManager` — Touch and mouse gestures
- `AssistantManager` — Assistant UI
- `HistoryManager` — Local history caching

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yabgo/yabgo-browser.git
cd yabgo-browser

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development with hot reload
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run tests
npm test -- --watch
```

### Build Process

```bash
# Build for your platform
npm run build

# Build for Windows
npm run build:win

# Build for all platforms
npm run build:all

# Run production build
npm run prod
```

### Key Design Patterns

#### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
Managers communicate through events for loose coupling:
```typescript
navigationManager.on('navigation', (url: string) => {
    uiManager.updateAddressBar(url);
    historyManager.addToHistory(url);
});
```

#### 2. Manager Pattern
Each functional area has a dedicated manager with clear responsibilities.

#### 3. Type Safety
Comprehensive TypeScript types ensure reliability and great developer experience.

### Adding Features

#### New Assistant Commands
```typescript
// In AssistantService.ts
if (this.matchesPatterns(lowerQuery, ['command-name'])) {
    return this.handleCommand();
}
```

#### New Gestures
```typescript
// In GestureManager.ts
private handleGestureAction(action: string): void {
    switch (action) {
        case 'new-gesture':
            this.emit('new-gesture');
            break;
    }
}
```

#### New UI Components
```typescript
// In UIManager.ts
private setupNewComponent(): void {
    const component = document.getElementById('component-id');
    component?.addEventListener('click', this.handleAction.bind(this));
}
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Specific test file
npm test -- WebviewLayout.test.ts
```

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript strict mode** — No implicit any, strict null checks
- **ESLint** — Consistent code style
- **Git workflow** — Feature branches, descriptive commits
- **Type annotations** — All functions must have return types

### Security Guidelines

1. **IPC Communication** — Validate all inputs from renderer
2. **WebView Security** — Enable appropriate sandbox settings
3. **Data Storage** — Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Start with debugger
npm run dev -- --inspect

# Enable database logging
const db = new Database(dbPath, { verbose: console.log });
```

### Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Don't pass large objects over IPC
- ❌ Don't enable node integration in renderer
- ❌ Don't forget to close database connections
- ✅ Always validate data between processes
- ✅ Use context isolation for security
- ✅ Handle promise rejections
