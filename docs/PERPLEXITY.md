# ðŸ¤– Perplexity AI Integration in YABGO Browser

## Overview

YABGO Browser now features integrated Perplexity AI support. When users ask questions or search queries, the assistant automatically routes them to Perplexity with the query pre-filled, enabling seamless AI-powered research and answers.

## How It Works

### Query Processing Flow

```
User Input
    â†“
AssistantManager.processQuery()
    â†“
AssistantService.processQuery()
    â†“
Matches Known Commands? (clear, recent, stats, etc.)
    â†“ (if no match)
handlePerplexityQuery()
    â†“
Returns navigate response with Perplexity URL
    â†“
AssistantManager detects navigate type
    â†“
Emits 'navigate' event with URL
    â†“
BrowserApp routes to TabManager.navigate()
    â†“
Tab opens Perplexity with query
```

## Components Modified

### 1. **AssistantService.ts** (Main Process)
- Added Perplexity URL constant: `https://www.perplexity.ai`
- Added `handlePerplexityQuery()` method
  - Encodes user query for URL
  - Constructs Perplexity search URL with query parameter
  - Returns navigation response with message
- Changed default search behavior to route to Perplexity

### 2. **DataTypes.ts** (Shared Types)
- Extended `AssistantResponse` interface
  - Added `'navigate'` to response type union
  - Added `url?: string` field for navigation URLs

### 3. **AssistantManager.ts** (Renderer Process)
- Enhanced `processQuery()` method
  - Detects `'navigate'` type responses
  - Extracts URL and emits `'navigate'` event
  - Shows user the action is taking place

### 4. **UIManager.ts** (Renderer Process)
- Updated `displayAssistantResponse()` method
  - Added handler for `'navigate'` response type
  - Shows "Opening Perplexity..." message
  - Auto-hides response after brief delay for smooth UX

### 5. **styles.css** (Styling)
- Added `.perplexity-info` styling
- Added `.loading-text` class with pulse animation
- Provides visual feedback while opening Perplexity

## User Experience

### Default Behavior
1. User types a question in the unified input
2. System checks if it's a known command (history, stats, search, etc.)
3. If not a command, it's treated as an AI query
4. Shows brief message: "ðŸ¤– Searching on Perplexity for: [query]"
5. New tab opens automatically with Perplexity pre-loaded with the query
6. User can see search results immediately in Perplexity

### Example Queries
```
User Input â†’ Action
"What is AI?" â†’ Opens Perplexity with search
"weather today" â†’ Opens Perplexity with search
"how to learn rust" â†’ Opens Perplexity with search
"recent" â†’ Shows recent browsing history (assistant command)
"stats" â†’ Shows browsing statistics (assistant command)
```

## Key Features

âœ… **Automatic Query Encoding** - Handles special characters and spaces
âœ… **Seamless Tab Integration** - Opens in new tab without interrupting current browsing
âœ… **Visual Feedback** - Shows user what's happening
âœ… **Command Preservation** - Local commands (history, stats) still work as expected
âœ… **Clean URL Construction** - Proper query parameter formatting

## Technical Implementation

### Perplexity URL Format
```
https://www.perplexity.ai?q=<encoded_query>
```

Example: For query "What is machine learning?"
```
https://www.perplexity.ai?q=What%20is%20machine%20learning%3F
```

### Response Types
```typescript
// Perplexity navigation response
{
    type: 'navigate',
    url: 'https://www.perplexity.ai?q=...',
    message: 'ðŸ¤– Searching on Perplexity for: ...'
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **API Integration** - Direct API calls for faster responses (requires API key)
2. **Custom Search Engines** - Allow users to switch between AI providers
3. **Response Caching** - Cache frequently asked questions locally
4. **Advanced Commands** - Add prefixes like "perplexity:", "search:", etc.
5. **Integration Settings** - Allow users to configure default AI provider

## Configuration

Currently, Perplexity is hardcoded as the default AI provider. To change this in the future:

**File: `src/main/services/AssistantService.ts`**
```typescript
private perplexityUrl: string = 'https://www.perplexity.ai';
```

To support multiple providers, modify the constructor:
```typescript
private aiProvider: string = process.env.AI_PROVIDER || 'perplexity';
private providerUrls: Record<string, string> = {
    perplexity: 'https://www.perplexity.ai',
    chatgpt: 'https://chat.openai.com',
    // etc.
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Perplexity doesn't open
- Verify internet connection
- Check that Perplexity website is accessible
- Look at browser console for errors

### Query not being passed to Perplexity
- Check if query contains special characters (they should be encoded)
- Verify `processQuery()` is being called in AssistantManager
- Check network tab to see actual URL being opened

### Still showing old response types
- Clear browser cache
- Rebuild the application: `npm run build`
- Restart the development server: `npm run dev`
